Malozemoff. Cryptology ePrint Archive 2014/779.\r\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2014/779.\r\n\r\nAll schemes use the graded encoding scheme of Coron et al. (CRYPTO,\r\n2013. https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/183).  The implementation is in a mix of\r\nPython and C, using [Sage](http://sagemath.org), [GNU GMP](https://gmplib.org)\r\nand [OpenMP](http://openmp.org).  <b>The code is under active development, and\r\nmay not be stable!</b> I will try to keep the master branch in a working state\r\n(most of the time), though.\r\n\r\nInstructions for building and running the code are in code/README.md, and\r\nscripts for running experiments and processing the results are in the scripts/\r\ndirectory.  Full traces of all the experiments found in the above paper can be\r\nfound in the scripts/results/ directory.\r\n\r\nFor any questions/comments, please e-mail amaloz at cs dot umd dot edu.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
